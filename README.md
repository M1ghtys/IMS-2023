### Program usage

./model -a <A> -b <B> -c <C> -d <D> -e <E> -f <F> -g <G> -h <H> -i <I> -p <P>

* where <A> is a number of cars measured on point A 
* where <B> is a number of cars measured on point B 
* where <C> is a number of cars measured on point C 
* where <D> is a number of cars measured on point D 
* where <E> is a number of cars measured on point E 
* where <F> is a number of cars measured on point F 
* where <G> is a number of cars measured on point G 
* where <H> is a number of cars measured on point H 
* where <I> is a number of iterations in minutes
* where <P> is a toggle for extended road network option

The car measurements are determined from the original junction study and are used as probabilites of car creation at certain junction points
